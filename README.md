# 🚀 Starbound Astronaut

**Starbound Astronaut** is a 2D platformer game developed as part of the **Game Development** course at the Polytechnic Institute of Viseu. In this game, you control an astronaut navigating through space, overcoming obstacles, and collecting diamonds while avoiding falling off platforms. If you fall, you lose life but respawn. The ultimate goal is to reach the portal that takes you to the next level, where moving enemies await. Avoid enemies to survive and advance to complete the game.
